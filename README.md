# Racial Discrimination in US Labor Market

##### There is no doubt that racial discrimination still occurs and affects the lives of people in their daily life, but are you also being affected when sending out resumes?

### Results - 
##### Our findings show that yes, your name has a significant effect on whether you are going to land that job interview or not. The statistics show that with a p-value of 1.931281906454845e-05 we can reject the hypothesis that a black sounding name will receive the same chances of a white sounding name with over 99% confidence.
